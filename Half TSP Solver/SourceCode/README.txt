Our code takes one input and gives one output file in .txt format. Input file must be in same directory with source code. Also, output file will be created in same directory of source code. 


Input -> In 107th line of code, there is:

input_file = open("test-input-4.txt",mode="r") #taking input

You can enter the name of test input in this line.


Output -> In 189th line of code, there is:

output_file = open("test-output-4.txt", mode="w")

You can enter the name of test output in this line.


Code is written in Python 3.8.9 and only two libraries which are Math and Time are imported. So, there must be no error when you run the code after arranging input and output files.
